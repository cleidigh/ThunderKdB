No time to implement.\n * Default and per-account training folder settings has been changed. Each folder URI textbox is replaced by an account selector and a folder path textbox.\n\n<b>Known major issues:</b>\n + Currently MailExtension API does not provide support for message parts on demand loading. Thus, in order to get headers the add-on has to load full mail message.\n + \"Unexpected error moving messages: 2147500037\" and \"Unexpected error copying messages: 2147500037\" while moving/copying messages with training buttons. Workaround: open a folder in the destination account before moving/copying (once per session is enough).\n\n<b>Migration from previous versions</b>\nThe add-on does not offer automated configuration migration from the XUL extension. After upgrade you should tweak the add-on configuration according to you needs."
