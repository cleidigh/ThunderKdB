upgradeInfo.encSubject.title=Encrypting the Message Subject
upgradeInfo.encSubject.desc=We developed a new method that moves the email subject into the encrypted message, and replaces the visible subject with "Encrypted Message". Once such a message is decrypted, the original subject is replaced automatically. Hiding the subject is on by default; there is a preference to turn it off if you don't like it. <i>(Note: this feature requires the message to be sent with PGP/MIME.)</i>
upgradeInfo.buttons.title=Changed behavior of Encrypt and Sign Buttons
upgradeInfo.buttons.desc=The <b>Encrypt</b> and <b>Sign</b> buttons in the message composer window now work for both the OpenPGP and S/MIME protocols. If both algorithms are possible, then Enigmail will try to prefer the one for which all keys are available.
upgradeInfo.autocrypt.title=Support for Autocrypt
upgradeInfo.autocrypt.desc=Enigmail now supports <a href="https://autocrypt.org/">Autocrypt</a>, a new standard to distribute keys as part of sent messages. Enigmail automatically imports keys from Autocrypt-compliant messages, such that over time more and more emails can be encrypted.
upgradeInfo.pEp.title=New p≡p Junior Mode (Pretty Easy Privacy)
upgradeInfo.pEp.desc=Enigmail now contains a <a href="https://pep-project.org/">p≡p</a> Junior Mode. The p≡p Junior Mode allows you to use OpenPGP encryption as transparently as possible; you don't need to care for key management and synchronization of keys between devices anymore.
