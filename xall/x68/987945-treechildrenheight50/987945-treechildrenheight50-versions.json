So, I decided that I made the function which let spaces between up and down sides of tree rows wider than the default. Of course, I placed the option of restoring the default state. This idea was from Outlook. I like Outlook, but I love Thunderbird. I think that Thunderbird is top email and calendar management application which is the advancing lead model as standard and impact.</b>\n\nNovember 14th 2020.\n\nFrom Sungho Hwang."
