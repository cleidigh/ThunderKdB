# BorderColors D

If you have Thundebird configured with multiple accounts or identities, you
might have sent emails from the wrong one once or twice. This add-on tries to
prevent that mistake by adding a colorful border around the "New message"
window.

You can configure each identity to have a different color, and choose among a
number of border styles: partial borders, gradients, etc.

This add-on builds on [BorderColors][bc] and [BorderColors-GT][bc-gt].
