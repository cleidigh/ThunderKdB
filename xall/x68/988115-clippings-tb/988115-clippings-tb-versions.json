This feature is experimental on macOS and Linux, where it is turned off by default\n• New option to skip backup reminders if there were no changes to your clippings since the last backup\n• In Clippings Manager, the Details Pane can be shown or hidden by pressing CTRL+D (Command+D on macOS)\n• User interface improvements to more closely match the rest of Thunderbird, as well as improved support for Dark Mode system themes on macOS and Windows (requires Thunderbird 91 or newer)\n• Bug fix: First-time backup dialog doesn't regain focus after Save As dialog dismissed\n• Added support for Dutch, French, German, and Portuguese (Brazil)"
