        "fr": "Read an e-mail, hit the Autofile button and your e-mail is automatically filed to the right mail folder based on the sender's address with no drag and drop needed. \n\nIf the current sender's address is not yet known from Autofile, Autofile asks you in what mail folder it will have to store mails from this sender. The next time you receive an e-mail from this sender, you will just hit the Autofile button to register it to this folder.\n\nTo accelerate the learning process, Autofile offers also to auto-register e-mail addresses and their target folder by inspecting all mail folders down the folder hierarchy starting from a root folder you specify.\n\nAt any time you can clear the Autofile memory for one sender e-mail address of for all sender e-mail addresses in a folder hierarchy.\n\nUse Ctl + Shift + W as a shortcut for hitting the Autofile button.\n\nBecause it makes things so simple, this add-on will save you lots of time and fluidify the way you handle your mail.\n\nNote: the add-on offers basically the same kind of service as the now defunct filemail add-on, with the advantage of an accelerated fast learning of target folders and added flexibility on recording de-recording e-mail addresses. Autofile works also in multi-accounts environment."

It will work with any future version of Thunderbird.\n\nFeel free to post suggestions or contact me."
