    <h2><img src="../../icons/urllink-48.png" alt="logo">&nbsp;&nbsp;URL Link</h2>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
    Select some text, in a web-page, text-input (web form) or email, and
    right-click.
    <ul>
      <li>
      If the text looks like a URL, you'll be able to directly open it (or into
      a tab) via “Open Selection”.
      </li>
      <li>
      If the text <i>doesn't</i> look like a link, you will get a sub-menu
      allowing it to be treated as a link anyway, or perform some customisable
      conversion first (<i>e.g.</i>, add “www.” and “.com”).
      </li>
      <li>
      Under preferences, where you can customise the sub-menu that appears, you
      can add your own separators with entries consisting solely of hyphens,
      for example: <tt>"--"</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
      Custom menu entries may contain any URL, nomatter how long, with the
      first '*' being replaced by the selection.  You may have a nickname
      before a bar '|' in the entry to shorten what appears in the menu:<br>
      <tt>"Short name|http://www.longname.com/q=*"</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
      Hold down &lt;Shift&gt; when selecting 'Open' to open in a new window
      instead of using the current window.
      </li>
      <li>
      Hold down &lt;Control&gt; when selecting 'Open' to open in a new
      <b>private</b> window instead of using the current window.  This can be
      forced for a specific custom menu entry by putting <b>|p</b> on the end
      of the URL.
      </li>
      <li>
      You may choose whether URL Link places its option near the top or the
      bottom of the standard context menu via a preference.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
      URL Link is a small Firefox and Thunderbird extension that allows you to
      select a non-URL in a mail/news message or web-page, and open it in a
      browser window.
      </li>

      <li>
      For emails, it reconnects links in emails which have been broken across
      several lines, and also replaces spaces with the URL character code %20
      so that you may follow emailed network `file:' links (which it
      auto-detects from Windows X: or UNC network references).
      </li>

      <li>
      For web pages, it also allows you to select textual links/URLs in web
      pages or edit boxes, and follow them as if they were real links. It will
      also let you use actual links, and analyses mailto: links as well.
      </li>

      <li>
      It breaks down `mailto:' links (converts, e.g.,
      mailto:someone@somesite.com to http://www.somesite.com), so you may visit
      a related website.
      </li>

      <li>
      It can `follow' javascript: links that would otherwise generate a pop-up
      (e.g., http://www.kelkoo.co.uk/ - although they've recently changed some
      of their links so that URL Link fails :-( I hope to work on that post
      2.0).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Custom search and replace</h3>
    <p>
    Custom search and replacements can be applied to the selection.  The
    default settings are two values that were in earlier versions of URL Link
    (for Thunderbird) and which can now be added to or replaced.  The
    replacement is done after leading &amp; trailing rubbish has been
    removed, and after all backslashes have been converted to forward
    slashes.
    <p>
    The entry format in the preferences tab is
    “searchRegExp||Replacement||regExpFlags”.  The final “||” and flags are
    optional;  the most likely (JavaScript) flag you may want is 'g' for
    “global” (or “replace-all”).  The replacement may contain the usual “$n”
    search pattern references.
    <p>
    <i>E.g.</i>, you receive emails with Windows file links like
    “\\server\share\file”.  However, you are on a Linux box with the Windows
    share mapped to “/mnt/smb/username/share”.  You would need to add an
    entry to the end of the list (note that backslashes have already been
    converted and the default entries convert “//server/share” to
    “file:///server/share”) of the form:
    “file:///server/share||file:///mnt/smb/username/share”.
    <p>
    If you need to debug your expressions, add the special (to URL Link) RegExp
    flag “D”, as in: ‘from||to||D’.  Then, URL Link will open an alert window
    telling you what your expression is (“Conversion:”), what the selection is
    at that point (“From:”) and what the expression has done to the selection
    (“To:”).

    <h3>Forthcoming changes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
      Extend the custom search and replace when it is stable to allow arbitrary
      JavaScript code to be run over the selection as well.
      </li>
    </ul>
