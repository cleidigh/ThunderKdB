***AttachmentExtractor Continued***

--------

### Features

* This Thunderbird Add-on is a (work in progress) fixed version of the original Add-on "AttachmentExtractor" which is no longer supported and fixed by the original author. It extracts all attachments from selected messages and then can delete, detach and more.
* Some features have been removed out of this addons options dialog from up version 3 (Thunderbird 78) because of not being functional. However, the affected features did not work in the past version series (1.5.* and 2.*). So they do not represent a new loss.
* Unfortunately, this revised version of the original Add-on will no longer be fully functional with future Thunderbird releases and will no longer be possible with all its features as a Web-/MailExtension in the future. Perhaps there will at least be a limited version for future Thunderbird releases.

### Version series

* Version 4.*   - Thunderbird 91.*
* Version 3.*   - Thunderbird 78.*
* Version 2.*   - Thunderbird 68.*
* Version 1.5.* - Thunderbird 60.*

### Known issues

* When detaching/deleting attachments from multiple messages, there will be no links from the stripped messages to the saved attachments. To get this working we would need a small patch in Thunderbirds core, which was/is ignored by the core developers: RFE [Bug 1578801](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1578801).
