      <h1>Successfully installed {addon} </h1>
        <p>Thank you for installing {addon}. You are now running {addon} <b>{version}</b> on Thunderbird {appver}.</p>
        
  
    
 
        <h2>New/Hidden Features</h2>    
  
    
        <li><b>Preview notes on mouseover:</b></li>
        <p>If you display the {addon} column and widen it, so that the three dots are shown for a note, 
          but no text: then, on mouseover/hover, a little window will show the note text. The message does not need to be selected.
        This can be used to get a fast overview over all notes indicated in the messagelist.
      The number of characters shown can be chosen in the settings (tools->addon settings-> xnote++).</p>
      <p></p>
      <li><b>Keyboard operation:</b></li>
      <p>New note: Shift+F10 - x - c, Modify note: Shift+F10 - x -m, Delete note: Shift+F10 - x - d  (varies by TB language). Some keyboards have a 
        'context menu' key, which can be used instead of shift+F10</p>
      <p></p>
      <li><b>Set note position on screen:</b></li>
       <p>{addon} now allows to set the standard screen position for notes in the settings. It is even possible to
         choose a position outside of the main TB window. So the note will no longer cover parts of the TB window.
       </p>

        <h2>Help with a Donation!</h2>
        
        <p>This Add-on is not written
          by a large corporation, nor is it sponsored in any way by Mozilla.
          </p>
          
        <p>In order to keep the addons working, Add-on authors have  to raise the funds
          necessary to repair and rewrite so that our users can keep benefiting
          from the functionality we bring to extend Thunderbird.
        </p>
        <p>
          In TB 78, Thunderbird internals changed widely. Klaus Buecher/opto and Lorenz Froihofer 
          are working to make {addon} fully 
          functional again. At lot of personal time has been put into this. We appreciate if you can support
        this work by a donation. </p>
