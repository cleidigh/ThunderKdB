reset_javascript_to_default.title=Allow HTML Temp - Important Note!
reset_javascript_to_default.message=Apparently you had deactivated JavaScript in Thunderbird in the past with the help of "Allow HTML Temp". This can lead to undesired malfunctions of the program (e.g. the account login by OAuth could fail).\n\nThe associated previous option in the "Allow HTML Temp" add-on has therefore been removed, and JavaScript has now been reactivated once(!) to restore the default in Thunderbird (in about: config "javascript.enabled" = true).\n\nThunderbird itself has been restricting JavaScript functions for a long time in the display of e-mail and other messages in order to guarantee security. So it should not be necessary to worry about it while reading email.
