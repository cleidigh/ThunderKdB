# Thunderbird addon: Limit non-BCC Recipients (MX)

## Description

This Mail Extension is a partial replacement for the Use BCC Instead C addon, which will not work after TBv70. 
It offers these features of Use BCC Instead:
* Counts 'To' and 'CC' email recipients and compares the total with the user's limit (in preferences)
* Recipients in mailing lists are counted
* If the limit is exceeded it displays a dialog - send or cancel
* There is an option to send but change all recipients to BCC

It does not offer these features of Use BCC Instead:
* Change the default in the compose window from TO to BCC
* A button to change all recipients between TO, CC, and BCC
* An extra column -  'Recipient Extended' - in the thread pane

## Requirements

Requires Thunderbird version 75+
