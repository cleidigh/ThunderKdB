<b>Release 5.1</b>
<ul>
<li> In order to maintain full functionality, this Add-on had to be rewritten as a mail extension with experiment API, which will require full permissions on installation. As regards being allowed to do stuff, it is actually not different with any classic Add-on: they always had full access to all functions within Thunderbird. The modern mail extensions will have much more tightly managed permissions - eventually QuickFolders will also use this more modern approach - but the APIs for this have to be created and accepted by Mozilla first. This means a lot of ongoing work for the nexty 12 months forward - please support this with a license or donation:</li>
<li>You can <a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/quickfolders?referrer=qf-version-page">buy a license</a> here. This is the preferred way of funding all the ongoing work and improvements.</li>
<li>If you are not ready for a license you can also <a href="https://quickfolders.org/donate.html#donate">donate from here</a></ul>
