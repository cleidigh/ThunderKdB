<b>Release 5.2</b>
<ul>
<li> In order to maintain full functionality, this Add-on had to be rewritten as a mail extension with experiment API, which will require full permissions on installation. As regards being allowed to do stuff, it is actually not different with any classic Add-on: they always had full access to all functions within Thunderbird. The modern mail extensions will have much more tightly managed permissions - eventually QuickFolders will also be able use this more modern approach - but the APIs for this have to be created and accepted by Mozilla first. This means a lot of ongoing work for the next 12 months forward - please support this with a license or donation:</li>
<li>You can <a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/quickfolders?referrer=qf-version-page">buy a license</a> here. This is the preferred way of funding all the ongoing work and improvements.</li>
<li>If you are not ready for a license you can also <a href="https://quickfolders.org/donate.html#donate">donate from here</a></ul>

<b>Changes / Items worked</b>
<ul>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/92">[issue 92]</a> - do not apply To address from advanced tab properties when replying to an email!</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/94">[issue 94]</a> - Tb78: Tab-specific properties displayed in incorrect screen position.</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/75">[issue 75]</a> Support moving folders via quickMove button. You can now move one or multiple folders by dragging them from the tree to the quickMove button or hitting Shift+M (with a Pro License) while  the folder tree is highlighted. Up until now, you could only move folders by holding Shift and dragging to a QuickFolders tab.</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/96">[issue 96]</a> Drag'n'drop issue in Thunderbird 85 beta. Although I fixed this particular issue I make no guarantees for any functionality if you are using beta versions. I can only support the current ESR version Thunderbird 78.1 - 78.* fully.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/23">[issue 23]</a> Fixed: quickMove aborts with "Nothing to do: Message is already in folder" if the first mail in the selection is already in target folder. This may happen if you drag mails from a multi-folder view such as a search results window. It can also happen if you execute the quickMove command after a while and you (or a filter) have moved some of the mails to the target folder already.</li>
</ul>
