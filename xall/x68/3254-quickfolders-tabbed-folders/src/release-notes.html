<b>Release 5.7.2</b>
In order to maintain full functionality, this Add-on had to be rewritten as a mail extension with experiment API, which will require full permissions on installation. As regards being allowed to do stuff, it is actually not different with any classic Add-on: they always had full access to all functions within Thunderbird. The modern mail extensions will have much more tightly managed permissions - eventually QuickFolders will also be able use this more modern approach - but the APIs for this have to be created and accepted by Mozilla first. This means a lot of ongoing work for the next 12 months forward - please support this by buying a license:

Or get the new cheaper <a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/quickfoldersstandard?referrer=qf-version-page" target="_blank">QuickFolders Standard License</a>. This is the preferred way of funding all the ongoing work and improvements.
