As regards being allowed to do stuff, it is actually not different with any classic Add-on: they always had full access to all functions within Thunderbird. The modern mail extensions will have much more tightly managed permissions - eventually QuickFolders will also be able use this more modern approach - but the APIs for this have to be created and accepted by Mozilla first.

            "en-US": "<b>Release 5.5.1</b>\n<ul><li> In order to maintain full functionality, this Add-on had to be rewritten as a mail extension with experiment API, which will require full permissions on installation. As regards being allowed to do stuff, it is actually not different with any classic Add-on: they always had full access to all functions within Thunderbird. The modern mail extensions will have much more tightly managed permissions - eventually QuickFolders will also be able use this more modern approach - but the APIs for this have to be created and accepted by Mozilla first. This means a lot of ongoing work for the next 12 months forward - please support this with a license or donation:</li><li>You can <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/quickfolders?referrer=qf-version-page\">buy a license</a> here.

To make changes visible one had to click \"Refrehs Visible tabs\" </li><li> 5.5.1: Rewrote the legacy style localization to use the modern method which is a prerequisite for converting the Add-on to a \"mail extension\" in the future. </li><li> Version 5.5.1: Completed Hungarian, Simplified Chinese and Catalan locales.</li><b>Improvements</b><ul><li> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/136\">[issue 136]</a> Fixed: There were no folder suggestions during quickJump / quickMove while viewing mails in a virtual folder view (such as search results / or after open message in conversation). This was a  side effect of changes from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/57\">[issue 57]</a>.</li><li> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/135\">[issue 135]</a> quickMove / quickJump: When using \"/\" for parent folders searching for substrings should work better... The Search algorithm now recognizes Underscore _ and Space within folder names so that parent folders with  prefixes such as \"01_test\" can still be found without knowing the number (type \"test\\subfoldername\" to get \na match in this example). </li><li> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/132\">[issue 132]</a> In a single message tab, quickMove used to redisplay the mail after moving it with quickMove.\nThis behavior has now been changed on request to go to the next email instead. If necessary, this new behavior can be changed in via the advanced search settings button in the Single Message Tab box on the QF Pro settings tab.</li><li> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/134\">[issue 134]</a> Feature Request: Escape key to \"Cancel quickMove\" completely. Before this change, Cancel would hide the search box but keep the list of mails queued to be moved so that more items could be added later. If necessary, the old behavior can be restored in the Advanced search settings dialog. </li><li> Changed folder tree shortcut from F7 to F9 (consistent with Thunderbird 68).  Push F0 to make the folder tree visible or quickly hide it.</li><li>Increased maximum subfolders in a dropdown menu from 100 to 250.</li><li> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/140\">[issue 140]</a> Fixed: Restriction to current server unexpectedly suggests creating new subfolder.</li></ul></ul>"

As regards being allowed to do stuff, it is actually not different with any classic Add-on: they always had full access to all functions within Thunderbird. The modern mail extensions will have much more tightly managed permissions - eventually QuickFolders will also be able use this more modern approach - but the APIs for this have to be created and accepted by Mozilla first. This means a lot of ongoing work for the next 12 months forward - please support this with a license or donation:</li><li>You can <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/quickfolders?referrer=qf-version-page\">buy a license</a> here.

The space (and possibly other non-ASCII characters, such as Umlauts / diacritics),  would be url encoded (Space = <code>%20</code>) and could lead to failure of moving the mail or duplicated folders or non-working QuickFolders tabs.\n\nThis problem was reported during the thunderbird 68.* release cycle so the fix may affect older versions of Thunderbird negatively. For user of older Thunderbird versions the behavior can be reverted by using the configuration setting: <code>extensions.quickfolders.newFolderCallback.encodeURI  = true</code></li><li> FIXED IN 4.18.1:&lt;br&gt;<a href=\"https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/34\" rel=\"nofollow\">[issue 34]</a> Option to make QuickFolders appear at the Bottom of Other Toolbars\n\nThe new setting <i>Advanced / QuickFolders Bar Position</i> can be used to change the order of toolbars to push the QuickFolders bar further up / down in case other 3rd party toolbars are used. Set to 0 to have the toolbar at the top, 100 should work to push it below all other toolbars.\n\nThe default is now set to make QuickFolders appear at the bottom of the mail tools again.</li></ul>"

To keep having support sites and ongoing development, please <a href=\"http://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/quickfolders?referrer=qf-version-page\" rel=\"nofollow\">buy a license</a> (the migration will cost around $500, so there are some expense I hope to recover from the user community).\n\nI will also have to rewrite all mail Add-ons as web extensions, which is currently not yet possible as all necessary APIs to replace the deprecated tech has not been implemented. As in between step I plan to release QuickFolders as a \"web experiment\" for Thunderbird 78+ but this will take a few weeks of work. If you are interested in using a version of  QuickFolders that works with Thunderbird 78, <a href=\"http://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/quickfolders?referrer=qf-version-page\" rel=\"nofollow\">buy a license</a> to support the project.</li><li> <a href=\"https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/27\" rel=\"nofollow\">[issue 27]</a> Drag to Create New Subfolders from tab could create unexpected results, if the entered folder name contained spaces. The space (and possibly other non-ASCII characters, such as Umlauts / diacritics),  would be url encoded (Space = <code>%20</code>) and could lead to failure of moving the mail or duplicated folders or non-working QuickFolders tabs.\n\nThis problem was reported during the thunderbird 68.* release cycle so the fix may affect older versions of Thunderbird negatively. For user of older Thunderbird versions the behavior can be reverted by using the configuration setting: <code>extensions.quickfolders.newFolderCallback.encodeURI  = true</code></li><li> New hidden setting <code>extensions.quickfolders.toolbar.ordinalPosition</code> can be used to change the order of toolbars to push the QuickFolders bar further up / down in case other 3rd party toolbars are used.</li></ul>"

This is fixed as of version 4.13.2 - hold down CONTROL and right-click any tab, select <i>Customize Icons...</i> The icon will be visible on the QuickFolders Tab and also in the folder tree for easy reference (Thunderbird only).\n\nYou can download a compatible set of 16px² icons <a href=\"http://quickfolders.org/downloads/quickFoldersIcons.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.  You may have to enable the icons menu in QuickFolders Options  / Advanced / QuickFolders Commands / Customize Icon.</li><li> Removed code that opened donation tab on update. From now on, only the change log will be displayed whenever QuickFolders is updated.  This may include promotions for QuickFolders licenses and videos related to my Thunderbird Add-ons. Also repurposed the \"donate\" buttons for selling licenses.</li><li> <a href=\"https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26644\" rel=\"nofollow\">[Bug 26644]</a> High CPU usage caused by \"Renew License\" button.&lt;br&gt;\nIn some Linux systems the animated License Renewal buttons can lead to performance issues. This is connected to missing graphics acceleration for certain CSS animations.</li><li> Thunderbird 60: (4.13.2) fixed platform specific style rules for Linux / Mac systems which weren't loaded anymore due to recent deprecation of the \"platform\" switch in install manifests.</li><li> <a href=\"http://binaryoutcast.com/projects/interlink/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Interlink</a> only: fixed the position of the QuickFolders toolbar (it is now shown underneath the mail tabs above the list of emails where is belongs).</li><li> Added logic for extending license <i>before expiry</i>. Now you can extend your QuickFolders license up to 30 days before it expires. Just click the \"Extend License\" button on the QuickFolders Pro tab in the options dialog.</li><li> The minimum version of Postbox was raised to 5.0 - note that after 5.5beta6 Postbox sadly does not support Add-ons anymore.</li></ul>"
