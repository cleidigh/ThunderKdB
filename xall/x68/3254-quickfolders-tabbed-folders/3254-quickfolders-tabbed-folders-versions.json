The modern mail extensions will have much more tightly managed permissions - eventually QuickFolders will also be able use this more modern approach - but the APIs for this have to be created and accepted by Mozilla first.

This is fixed as of version 4.13.2 - hold down CONTROL and right-click any tab, select <i>Customize Icons...</i> The icon will be visible on the QuickFolders Tab and also in the folder tree for easy reference (Thunderbird only).\n\nYou can download a compatible set of 16px² icons <a href=\"http://quickfolders.org/downloads/quickFoldersIcons.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.  You may have to enable the icons menu in QuickFolders Options  / Advanced / QuickFolders Commands / Customize Icon.</li><li> Removed code that opened donation tab on update. From now on, only the change log will be displayed whenever QuickFolders is updated.  This may include promotions for QuickFolders licenses and videos related to my Thunderbird Add-ons. Also repurposed the \"donate\" buttons for selling licenses.</li><li> <a href=\"https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26644\" rel=\"nofollow\">[Bug 26644]</a> High CPU usage caused by \"Renew License\" button.&lt;br&gt;\nIn some Linux systems the animated License Renewal buttons can lead to performance issues. This is connected to missing graphics acceleration for certain CSS animations.</li><li> Thunderbird 60: (4.13.2) fixed platform specific style rules for Linux / Mac systems which weren't loaded anymore due to recent deprecation of the \"platform\" switch in install manifests.</li><li> <a href=\"http://binaryoutcast.com/projects/interlink/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Interlink</a> only: fixed the position of the QuickFolders toolbar (it is now shown underneath the mail tabs above the list of emails where is belongs).</li><li> Added logic for extending license <i>before expiry</i>. Now you can extend your QuickFolders license up to 30 days before it expires. Just click the \"Extend License\" button on the QuickFolders Pro tab in the options dialog.</li><li> The minimum version of Postbox was raised to 5.0 - note that after 5.5beta6 Postbox sadly does not support Add-ons anymore.</li></ul>"

The profits from Registration are used to develop and distribute the program further and to feed the author, as he would like to spend more time developing open source software. Some Premium features may be available in the free software, but they may be restricted (e.g. through a notification to the registration). Premium features are not essential to the core functionality of the Program, but are there to provide an incentive for financially supporting the enhancement and support of the Software. \n\nRegistration Scheme\nRegistration is carried out via our web shop (FastSpring) which sells registration keys. Registration keys are personal, non-transferrable and usually restricted to a time period (typically one year). To protect their personal nature they are tied to the user's Email address.\n\nMotivation \nAs regards licensing, we want to avoid a situation where the project is reused in order to avoid our monetisation by giving this away for free or cheaper than us thus disincentivising the current developers from putting a lot of time into development and support.\n\nIf plan to you use large portions of the code please contact the author (Axel Grude)\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
