Therefore, what the configuration above says is, \"Block remote images for any messages that arrive in folders named Spam, Trash, Deleted Items, or Deleted Messages, and display remote images for messages that arrive in any other folder.\" Note that rather than using <strong>.*</strong> as the allow regexp, I could just as well have used <strong>^</strong> by itself, which would mean, \"Match any string which has a beginning,\" which means any non-empty string (obviously folder names are not empty).\n\nGenerally speaking, to list any arbitrary set of folder names in the \"Allow regexp\" or \"Block regexp\" setting, do the following:\n\n<ol><li>Start with <strong>^</strong> to indicate the beginning of the string.</li><li>Next put <strong>(</strong> to begin the list of folder names.</li><li>List the folder names separated by <strong>|</strong>, but put a backslash (<strong>\\</strong>) in front of any symbol in a folder name, to ensure that it isn't treated as a special regexp character.</li><li>End with <strong>)$</strong> to mark the end of the list of folder names and the end of the string being matched.</li></ol> \nNote that the settings you specify for Remote Content By Folder are only applied when the message first arrives. If you change the settings Thunderbird won't go back and re-evaluate whether to display images for existing messages, and if you move or copy a message from one folder to another Thunderbird won't re-evaluate whether to display images based on the target folder.\n\nSimilarly, this only impacts messages for which the question, \"Should remote images be displayed?\" has never been answered before. So if Thunderbird decides to block images in a message and puts up the banner, and then you tell it to display the images in that message, that will stick even if the message is in a folder that Remote Content By Folder thinks images should be blocked in.",
