Due to performance reasons, this only works if cache is enabled. Folder filter is deactivated for `All Accounts (Sum)`, date range filter can be used with it. Keep in mind, that processing of a lot of large accounts can take a huge amount of time.\n\n<b>Open Overall Stats from Popup menu</b>\nOverall stats can now directly be opened via the popup menu.\nThe URL of the stats page changed. Already opened stats pages have to be closed and reopened again via the popup menu.\n\n<b>Timestamps</b>\nInformation about how old the displayed data is was added to the stats page in an information section below the filter. Passed time gets updated live in human readable units. It also shows the specific data retrieval date in a tooltip on hover.\n\n<b>Self Messages</b>\nAn option to handle self messages (messages from me to myself) was added. This can be `disabled` (default) to treat every email the same. It can be set to `Same Account Only` (Messages where sender and receiver are identities from the same account will be excluded) and `From Any Account` (Messages where sender and receiver are identities from any account will be excluded).\nNote that only \"pure self messages\" are taken into account, where all recipients match the corresponding identities. If e.g. a message was sent to one of my identities and another recipient, it's not counted\n\n<b>Progress Indicator</b>\nA top page progress indication bar was added, to show progress while data is retrieved. Percentage is shown on hover.\n\n<b>Leader Count</b>\nAn option to define the number of entries in leader-boards (most received from, most sent to) was added. Allowed are numbers between 1 and 999 due to keeping a reasonable cache size.\n\n<b>Show all accounts in Popup menu</b>\nAccount tiles are now two column and overflow content can be reached via scrolling.\n\n<b>Fix data of week 53</b>\nDays of January before week 1 got counted for week 53 of current year instead of week 53 of previous year.
