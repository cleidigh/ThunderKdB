<b>Latest News</b>

We had to rewrite much of the code to become compatible with Thunderbird 78. To keep having support sites and ongoing development, please <a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/smarttemplate4?referrer=st-version-page">buy a Pro license</a>

Migration to the Thunderbird 78 Add-ons system - mail extensions with experimental APIs - was time intensive and costly. This is only the first step toward future proofing, next year Thunderbird may restrict the use of experimental APIs, which depends on having new APIs available on the Core side of the code. This relies on a good relationship between Add-on developers and the Core team (Thunderbird Council) and requires ongoing talking and design work on both sides; that's why the licensing model once again shows its superiority as it is able to fund the necessary time that needs to be spent.
