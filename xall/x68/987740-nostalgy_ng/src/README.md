Summary
=======

Nostalgy++ is an extension for Mozilla Thunderbird whose purpose is to
save time by doing more operations with the keyboard. If you want to
use Thunderbird without sacrificing the productivity you had with good
old mutt/pine, this extension is for you!

Nostalgy++ is based on Nostalgy by Alain Frish, then updated to TB 68 and now TB 78.
Also, there are now some extensions of the original functionality.

Nostalgy++ is especially useful if you have long folderlists and need to sort emails 
into those folders.

Nostalgy++ adds keyboard shortcuts to change folder, move/copy messages,
with folder name auto-completion (using only the keyboard).  It also
includes a system of rules to suggest a target folder for saving
messages; re-creates Eudora's Alt-Click; facilitates navigation in the
3-pane window; makes it easy to change between To/Bcc/Cc fields in the
composer. All that with the keyboard only!

New functions include the creation of new rules from the main window,
the conversion of the latest move operation into a new rule.
The rule listing window allows to directly apply a rule, without needing to set 
Thunderbird to the right folder.

For the compose window, it can be chosen to always display the cc or bcc lines, 
which are now hidden in TB 78 by default.

Other keyboard actions include: changing focus between panes, scroll
the message while keeping the focus on the thread pane, changing
header in the composer (To/Cc/Bcc), adding an attachment, hide the
folder view.


Installation
============

The easiest way to install Nostalgy++ is through  Thunderbird`s addon page. It
will automatically update itself when new versions are released.
