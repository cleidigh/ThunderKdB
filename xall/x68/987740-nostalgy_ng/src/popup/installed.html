        <h2>New Features and Bug Fixes in 3.0.1</h2>   
    
        <p>New design for selecting keys and displaying the rules, including a scrollbar on the rules table.</p>
        <p>Bugfix: Solving a problem with TB, where Nostalgy++ works on 32 bit TB, but has timing problems with keys on 64 bit TB</p>
          <p>Known issue: keys not working in message window, history list not displayed.</p>
          <p>Due to TB becoming multiprocess, timing between tasks suddenly is a problem. This may also depend on PC speed.
            If something is not working, please enter an issue at github or send an email (see ATN page for email address)
          </p>
    
 
        <h2>New Features and Bug Fixes in 2.3</h2>    
  
 
        <li><b>New folder search:</b></li>
        <p>Nostalgy++ now allows multiple search criteria. For example, '<b>in no</b>' will find <b>in</b>box/software/<b>no</b>stalgy. '<b>ar no</b>'
          will find <b>ar</b>chive/software/<b>no</b>stalgy. Just using 'no' will find both. Two or more criteria or parts of foldernames are allowed. Don't type the '!
          </p>
     
 
          <li><b>Go back to previous folder:</b></li>
          <p>While G allows to go to a folder, alt-G will go back to where you came from. Now it is easy just to look something up in a 
            folder and then go back.</p>
 
 
            <li><b>Attachments and image thumbnails:</b></li>
        <p>Esc-r opens the attachment list. Esc-1, esc-2 etc. display attached images 1, 2, ... inside TB (no external app needed).
          </p>
     
          <li><b>Width of folderbox:</b></li>
          <p>The width of the folderbox can be adjusted in about:preferences (Number of characters if foldernames are long).</p>
          <p></p>
     
          <li><b>Apply rule to all folders: </b></li>
          <p>Folder: 'Under' in a rule may be empty: If no folder is entered for 'Under', the rule will be applied in any folder.</p>
           <p></p>
               
        
          <li><b>Create new rule, Convert last email move into rule, Apply rule:</b></li>
        <p>A new rule can now be created from the main window. The folderset used for the last email move can be inserted into a new rule. 
          In the rule list, the rules can be directly applied without opening the folders in Thunderbird's main view.
        </p>
    
         <li><b>Composer:  Switch to cc or bcc line</b></li>
           
       <p>By keyboard, esc followed by c, the cc line is shown and focused. Similiarly, esc - b opens the bcc , esc-t the to line. 
        Just as in earlier versions, cc (+space), bcc (+space), to (+space) can be used as well (<b>disabled in 2.2.3</b>).</p>
    <p></p>    
       <p></p>    
       <li><b>Composer:  Always show cc or bcc line</b></li>
           
       <p>In the preferences, you can choose to have cc and/or bcc line always visible</p>
       <p></p>    
       <p>You can report issues at
        the home page for TB78: <a href='https://github.com/opto/nostalgy-xpi/issues'>Nostalgy++.</a>

         In TB 78, Thunderbird internals changed widely. Klaus Buecher/opto has been working to make {addon} fully 
         functional again for Thunderbird 78. At lot of personal time has been put into this. I appreciate if you can support
       this work by a donation. </p>
