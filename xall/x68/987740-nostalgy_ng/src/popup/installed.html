        Just as in earlier versions, cc (+space), bcc (+space), to (+space) can be used as well (<b>disabled in 2.2.3</b>).</p>

         In TB 78, Thunderbird internals changed widely. Klaus Buecher/opto has been working to make {addon} fully 
         functional again for Thunderbird 78. At lot of personal time has been put into this. I appreciate if you can support
       this work by a donation. </p>
