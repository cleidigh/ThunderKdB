Different accounts with their identities are now separated by a line.\n\n– Option to sort the identities of each account\n\n– \"Reply All\" with altered \"From\" account doesn't include the original receiving address in the list of recipients any more\n\n– Various fixes and internal changes",

You could configure TB to set a different return address for you when you are working with your folders, and for the other user when they are using theirs.  Alternatively, if you use a different mailing address for a mailing list, you can use this extension to set your return address appropriately when you working with the list’s folder.\n\nThe second thing this extension does is allow you to set a default To address for newly composed messages based on which folder you are working in.  This could be very useful for mailing lists – when you create a new message in the mailing list folder, your message would automatically be correctly addressed.\n\nIn both cases, if the current folder has no From address or To address specified, the extension will check the parent folder, so you can control the settings for an enti name=\"data[Addon][summary][]\"",
