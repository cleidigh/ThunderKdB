Tools for quicker searching:    Quicker quicksearch


This addon introduces some tools to help with quicker searching.

Every message in the messagelist has a new entry in its context (rightclick) menu:


*   Quicksearch: email (click) / domain (Ctrl-click)  


'Click':      If this is clicked, the full emailaddress is inserted into the quick search box. So the messagelist will only show emails from/to this email address.

'Ctrl-Click': If this is clicked while ctrl is held down, the domain (xyz.de, for example) is entered into the quicksearch box. Now, all emails from/to all email addresses of that domain will be displayed.


by keyboard:

Ctrl+Alt+H: copy author to quicksearch box<br>
Ctrl+Alt+J: copy domain to quicksearch box<br>
