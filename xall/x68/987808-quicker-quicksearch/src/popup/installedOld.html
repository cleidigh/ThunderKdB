<b>Quicker quicksearch</b>
<br><br>
This addon introduces some tools to help with quicker searching.
<br><br>
Every message in the messagelist has a new entry in its context (rightclick) menu:
<br><br>

<ul><li>   Quicksearch: email (click) / domain (Ctrl-click)  </li></ul>
<br><br>

<b>'Click'</b>:If this is clicked, the full emailaddress is inserted into the quick search box. So the messagelist will only show emails from/to this email address.
<br>     <br>
<b>'Ctrl-Click'</b>: If this is clicked while ctrl is held down, the domain (xyz.de, for example) is entered into the quicksearch box. Now, all emails from/to all email addresses of that domain will be displayed.
</ul>
<br><br>     <br>
<b> by keyboard:</b><br>   <br>

<b>Ctrl+Alt+H:</b> copy author to quicksearch box<br>
<b>Ctrl+Alt+J:</b> copy domain to quicksearch box<br>
  </body>
