         <br>
          This addon introduces some tools to help with quicker searching. 
       
          Every message in the messagelist has a new entry in its context (rightclick) menu:
          <br>
          
          <ul><li>   Quicksearch: email (click) / domain (Ctrl-click) / subject (Alt-click) </li></ul>
          <br>
          
          <b>'Click'</b>:If this is clicked, the full emailaddress is inserted into the quick search box. So the messagelist will only show emails from/to this email address.
          <br>    
          <b>'Ctrl-Click'</b>: If this is clicked while ctrl is held down, the domain (xyz.de, for example) is entered into the quicksearch box. Now, all emails from/to all email addresses of that domain will be displayed.
          <br>
          <b>'Alt-Click'</b>: If this is clicked while alt is held down, the subject is entered into the quicksearch box. 
        </ul>
          <br><br>    
          <b> by keyboard:</b><br>   
          
          <b>Ctrl+Alt+B:</b> copy author to quicksearch box<br>
          <b>Ctrl+Alt+N:</b> copy domain to quicksearch box<br>   
          <b>Ctrl+Alt+H:</b> copy domain to quicksearch box<br>   
        
          <br></p>
       <p></p>
      <li><b>Other addons:</b></li>
             <p><b>Nostalgy++</b>: easy archiving/moving of emails to their destination folders, 
             with autocomplete of folder names and rules for suggested folder. 
             Compose window: always display cc or bcc, easy selecting input fields (to, cc, bcc, body, attachments), etc. 
          </p>
        <p><b>Text insert++</b>: Easy inserting standard text. br+ctrl-D converts to best regards. Define your own replacements. 
        Cursor can be in the middle of the replacement text.</p>
        <p><b>Attachment image viewer</b>: Download dialog shows thumbnail of image. Image viewer with zoom, rotate, flip, slideshow etc. </p>
        <p><b>XNote++</b>: Add notes to your emails to remind or to plan a reply.

          In TB 78, Thunderbird internals changed widely. Klaus Buecher/opto 
          is making {addon} fully 
          functional again. I appreciate if you can support
        this work by a donation. </p>
