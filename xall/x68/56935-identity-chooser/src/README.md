# Identity Chooser MX for Mozilla Thunderbird

Do you remember the first time you accidentally sent a work related
email from your private email account? Identity Chooser helps you to
prevent that. It makes choosing the sender address explicit:

* Do you want to compose a new email? Identity Chooser forces you to
  choose the sender address first.

* Do you want to forward an email? Identity Chooser forces you to
  choose the sender address first.

To make it short: Every time you'll create a new message, Identity
Chooser shows you a menu with all your identities.

Everything in Identity Chooser is about making explicit choices. No
automatisms, no defaults.

And as a result you'll never send an email from the wrong email
address again.
