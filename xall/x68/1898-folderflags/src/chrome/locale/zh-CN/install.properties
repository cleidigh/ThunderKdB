amo.description=让用户在文件夹上编辑 Thunderbird 设置的旗帜。例如，在任何文件夹上设置“废弃”旗帜（不只是个垃圾邮件的分类）然后 Thunderbird 将不再扫描该文件夹的垃圾邮件，这是建立本扩展的主要原因。
amo.developer_comments=FolderFlags cannot be used to switch which folder Thunderbird thinks trashed messages should go to on an IMAP server.  This is a separate preference; see http://kb.mozillazine.org/IMAP_Trash_folder for how to make the setting change.
amo.release_notes=FolderFlags 1.2 now includes an Edit menu option and correctly evalutes whether flags can be edited. The Virtual flag was removed.  Thunderbird 3 is now the only major version supported by FolderFlags.  Thunderbird 1.5 - 2.x users should use FolderFlags 1.1.1.
