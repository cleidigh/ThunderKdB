amo.description=Allows users to edit the flags Thunderbird sets on folders.  For instance, set the 'Junk' flag on any folder (not just the one spam is sorted into) and Thunderbird will no longer scan that folder for spam; this was the main reason the extension was created.
amo.developer_comments=FolderFlags cannot be used to switch which folder Thunderbird thinks trashed messages should go to on an IMAP server.  This is a separate preference; see http://kb.mozillazine.org/IMAP_Trash_folder for how to make the setting change.
amo.release_notes=FolderFlags 1.2 now includes an Edit menu option and correctly evalutes whether flags can be edited. The Virtual flag was removed.  Thunderbird 3 is now the only major version supported by FolderFlags.  Thunderbird 1.5 - 2.x users should use FolderFlags 1.1.1.
